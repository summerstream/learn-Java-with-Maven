This project is used for learning Java and Maven.

You do not have to use Eclipse,IntellJ Idea or any other IDE. However I strongly suggest you using Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

Nearly all the codes come from two articles from Spring website:

https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/
https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/

Below are some maven instructions used:

mvn compile
mvn package

cd target
java -jar gs-maven-0.1.0.jar 

mvn test
